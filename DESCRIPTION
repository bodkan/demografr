Description: A toolkit for simulation-based inferences of demographic models in
    population genetics, such as Approximate Bayesian Computation and grid-based
    simulation inference. Models are specified using the functionality of the
    'slendr' R package, and summary statistics are computed using its 'tskit'
    interface for tree-sequence analyses. Together with features for specifying
    parameter prior distribution and implicit parallelism, the users can build
    efficient, reproducible, and fully automated population genetic inference
    pipelines entirely in R.
