Description: A toolkit for simulation-based inferences of demographic models in
    population genetics, such as Approximate Bayesian Computation and simulations
    across parameter grids. Models are specified using the functionality of the
    slendr R package and summary statistics are computed using its interface to
    the 'tskit' tree-sequence library. Other components provided allow building
    of reproducible, fully automated inference pipelines entirely in R.
