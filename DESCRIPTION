Description: A toolkit for simulation-based inferences of demographic models in
    population genetics, such as Approximate Bayesian Computation, grid-based
    parameter sweeps, but also simulation-based parameter optimization.
    Population genetic models are specified using the functionality of the
    'slendr' R package, and summary statistics are computed using its interface
    to the 'tskit' tree-sequence Python module. Together with features for
    specifying prior distributions and implicit parallelism, users can use
    'demografr' to build efficient, reproducible, and fully automated
    population genetic inference pipelines entirely in R, while leveraging
    the available tools for model selection and diagnostics of the 'abc' package.
