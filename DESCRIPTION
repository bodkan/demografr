Description: A toolkit for simulation-based inferences of demographic models in
    population genetics, such as Approximate Bayesian Computation, grid-based
    parameter sweeps, but also simulation-based parameter optimization.
    Demographic models are specified using the standard functionality of the
    'slendr' R package, and summary statistics are computed using its 'tskit'
    interface for tree-sequence analyses. Together with features for specifying
    parameter prior distributions and implicit parallelism, users can build
    efficient, reproducible, and fully automated population genetic inference
    pipelines entirely in R.
